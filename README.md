# huggingface
Create a container to process inference requests from any pretrained model in the huggingface model hub: https://huggingface.co/models
Your solution should include server components to support multiple parallel incoming requests (e.g., NGINX/gunicorn)
Create a notebook to demonstrate requests that POST to the container endpoint and print out the response
Please explain why you have chosen this model as your demonstration
3) EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATION
Perform exploratory data analysis on any dataset in the huggingface datasets hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets
Include a notebook that contains your analysis within the repository
Please explain why you have chosen this dataset for your demonstration of exploratory data analysis
Document the process for using your updated repo in README.md so that we can try out your demo ourselves
Share the repo with the github users dcshapiro and elmathioso
